# BigMart Sales Prediction

A regression-based machine learning project that predicts sales of various BigMart outlets using historical data and item-level features.  
The goal is to help retailers make data-driven decisions related to inventory management and demand estimation.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

##  Problem Statement

BigMart is a retail chain that wants to forecast the sales of its outlets based on past trends.  
Using historical sales data, the objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict future sales and provide insights into key factors influencing sales performance.

## Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (missing values, encoding, and feature scaling).
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** to identify important sales trends and correlations.
- Built and compared multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Tuned model hyperparameters to improve prediction performance.
- Visualized results and insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Achieved **low RMSE** and better predictive accuracy over baseline methods.
